There’s no such thing as a guaranteed loan. Lenders that promise loan approval often have something up their sleeves — and it almost always ends up costing you more money in the end.

Lenders want to avoid risk. That sometimes means rejecting loan applications from borrowers who have a bad credit history. But a lender can’t assess your risk level without first getting a peek at your credit history.

That can only happen if you approve the lender to check your credit. Otherwise, a lender is blindly lending out money without knowing whether they will receive repayment. That’s why you won’t find reputable guaranteed loans.

But you can still find the loan you need, even if you have poor credit. Instead of turning to your local bank or credit union, consider an online lending network that partners with independent lenders that specialize in bad credit loan products.

There are thousands of consumers who receive online loans every day. Many of these borrowers have less-than-perfect credit. With an online network, you can submit a loan request in minutes and almost instantly receive a credit decision.

This is a convenient loan option for consumers who don’t want to travel around and submit multiple applications in search of an emergency loan.

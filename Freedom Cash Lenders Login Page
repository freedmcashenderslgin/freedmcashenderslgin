Many payday lenders will consider and accept your payday loan request without a credit check. Though not technically a secured loan, a payday loan is “secured” by your next paycheck.

When you accept a payday loan, you’re giving the lender the right to take some or all of your next paycheck to settle the debt. That security is often enough for the lender to waive a credit check.

But the lender will rarely take your check to claim its money. Instead, your loan is rolled into a new loan — with a higher interest rate and more fees. This will continue until you pay the loan in full or reach your state’s limitations on rollovers.
